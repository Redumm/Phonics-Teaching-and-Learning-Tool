# Phonics-Teaching-and-Learning-Tool

## A VB.NET tool which performs assessment, progress tracking, and personalized worksheet generation following the Read Write Inc. phonics programme for EYFS and KS1.

This tool focuses on the assessment, the progress tracking, and the targeted learning of students. Assessments performed on the tool are analysed and attributes which students make mistakes on such as digraphs, phonemes, number of sounds, etc. are recorded as well as their phonics level and date of assessment. This allows the teacher to track the progress of their students and see summaries of what they find the most difficult. As well as this, the tool can generate and print unique practice words and sounds for students which will target the areas in which they struggle the most. A full list of functions is detailed below:

* Perform Read Write Inc. assessments digitally and automatically determine a student's phonics level
* Automatically generate practice worksheets tailored to students based on their phonics level and previous mistakes
* Print generated practice worksheets
